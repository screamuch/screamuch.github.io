    <hr>

    <p>
        Bioengineering PhD student at University of Oregon, under guidance of <a href="https://knightcampus.uoregon.edu/tim-gardner">Tim Gardner</a>. Just started...
    </p>

    <p>
        At SF State I worked with <a href="https://chemistry.sfsu.edu/faculty/esquerra">Ray Esquerra</a> and <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/tom_zimmerman">Tom Zimmerman</a> on low-cost microscopes.
        I also worked with <a href="http://www.sfsu-icelab.org/">Xiaorong Zhang</a> and <a href="http://sfsu-miclab.org/">Zhuwei Qin</a> on neural interfaces,
        running deep learning on arduinos. Before that I was with <a href="https://cellgeometry.ucsf.edu/">Wallace Marshall</a> at UCSF
        studying cell cognition. Earlier, I worked with <a href="https://www.csueastbay.edu/directory/profiles/cs/ertaullevent.html">Levent Ertaul</a> on IoT security.
        Somewhere in between all of that I juggled software engineering internships at BridgeGood and 99Chairs, organized hackathons, and built content-generation plus optimal influencer-interaction pipelines.
    </p>

    <p>
        I grew up in Moscow, went to high school in rural Finland, came to San Francisco for college
        and stuck around. I did a random internship in Berlin and have traveled around most of the
        northern hemisphere. I ski, skateboard, and code for fun. Sometimes on commission. I also like to
        play music on my SP404, build audio-visual experiences, and craft visualizations of complex ideas - some of which made it into the San Francisco Exploratorium.

        <h3>RoboCam: Turning a 3D Printer into a Microscope</h3>
        <p>An automated microscope powered by a(ny) 3D printer chassis. With a $200 AliExpress lens it supports imaging up to 2um/px magnification, fluorescence and plate reading. It's actively used in fruit fly fecundity studies, cell motility and photoresponse studies, and more that I have already lost track of. Fully open source, easy to replicate and customize. Shipped to UCSF, Stanford (not really), and Knox College during my tenure.</p>

        <h3>NeuroEdge/Neural²: Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition on Embedded Systems</h3>
        <p>Reading muscle signals from your forearm and predicting hand gestures in real-time on a Sony microcontroller. We collected HD EMG data, trained a tiny neural net that fits on the chip, and got it running at 90% accuracy with 83ms latency.</p>

        <h3>Single Cell Intelligence & Engineering</h3>
        <p>Exploring cognition in single-celled organisms (<i>Stentor</i>, <i>Physarum</i>) and engineering them for artistic applications. Projects include studying habituation in <i>Stentor coeruleus</i>, modeling slime mold spatial dynamics, and creating interactive exhibits like <i>dinoflagellates</i> glowing to music or <i>Physarum</i> replicating the map of US highways at the Exploratorium.</p>

        <h3>An AI-based Method for Student Piano Performance Assessment</h3>
        <p>Built an AI that listens to you play piano, turns the audio into MIDI, lines it up with the sheet music, and lights up every mistake. It catches timing, dynamics, and accuracy so you instantly see what to fix next.</p>
